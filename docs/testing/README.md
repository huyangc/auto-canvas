# Test System

Tests protect current behavior, rejection boundaries and safety invariants.
The [contract matrix](contract-matrix.md) names each behavior's primary test.

## Layers

| Layer                 | Purpose                                                          | Typical location                            |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Static and generated  | types, formatting, documentation links, generated-output drift   | root scripts and `pnpm check`               |
| Unit                  | pure algorithms, value boundaries, deterministic transformations | adjacent `*.test.ts`                        |
| Module contract       | one package's public input/output, including rejection cases     | package test beside the public boundary     |
| Cross-module contract | one fact interpreted consistently across package boundaries      | owning boundary package, named for the fact |
| Browser workflow      | a user-visible flow that cannot be proved below the browser      | `apps/editor/e2e/`                          |
| Packaging and golden  | built product, artifacts, visual reference, packaging            | root scripts and local packaging checks     |

Use the cheapest layer that proves the behavior, one primary contract test per
behavior; add a higher-layer test only for wiring or a real user path the lower
layer cannot prove.

Agent client and MCP tests talk to the real editor via `liveAgentEditor()`
(`apps/editor/src/agent/live-agent-editor.test-support.ts`); script only relay
faults and the network services the editor calls, never the editor's answers.

## Local validation

`pnpm check` runs formatting, documentation links, generated Agent docs,
component generation checks, types, lint, local tests and the build in order.
Run focused unit/browser checks while editing, then every acceptance command
in the task plan before review. Record results and missing resources in the
task report, following the [repository workflow](../workflow.md).

`pnpm test:local` runs ordinary unit/module tests, including standalone tests
that build their own dependencies. `pnpm test:e2e:local` runs browser workflows;
run `pnpm setup:e2e` once per machine or Playwright version when needed.
`pnpm test:desktop-build`, `pnpm mcp:package` and `pnpm headless:package` check
local packaging. Golden and performance scripts remain available for changes
that affect their contracts.

## Environment-dependent execution

Simulation and native model checks still need their engine-specific resources.
A skipped target does not qualify environment-dependent behavior. Record the
simulator, inputs, candidate and missing resources in the task report; one
engine's assertions cannot qualify another engine. See the
[simulation execution contract](../specs/simulation-execution.md).

## Timing evidence

Browser reports distinguish cumulative attempt cost (including retries), the
slowest single attempt and elapsed time per run. Parallel runs can overlap;
neither summed test cost nor queue time is test execution wall time. A run
killed before producing its report has missing timing evidence, not zero cost.

## Test-Impact

Every commit that changes product code, tests or tooling ends its message with
one trailer; Opus checks it in review (no CI check):

```text
Test-Impact: tests-updated
Test-Impact: no-test-change — <evidence that behavior did not change>
```

## Removing or simplifying a test

Keep rejection, migration, authorization and input-hardening tests while their
boundary is reachable. Remove or merge a test only when all hold:

1. Its production surface is unreachable or covered by a named primary
   contract at the same or stronger boundary.
2. It is not the only rejection, compatibility, history or safety assertion for
   the behavior.
3. The task report names the replacement protection or why none is needed.

A browser test meets condition 1 when a named lower-layer test covers it,
unless the browser is the point (pointer or focus, layout, font metrics,
clipboard, download, cross-tab, or the flow's only GUI wiring test); push any
uncovered assertion down first.

## Unused code and file size

An export only tests use is dead (`pnpm deadcode`):
delete it with its tests under the rules above, or tag it `@internal` with the
reason. For a changed product file past 1,000 lines , the
reviewer decides whether to split it along its seams. Coverage is diagnostic,
never a threshold.

## Circuit/model and fixture validation

Each circuit fixture lives in `netlists/<circuit-name>/` with its local models.
Preserve `.subckt` interfaces, pin order (changes check every caller) and
foundry data; label simplified models and topology-only fixtures.

Electrical behavior changes report simulator, models, analyses, corners and
acceptance criteria, or why simulation is blocked; syntax inspection alone
proves nothing electrical.

Native model-source acceptance (operator-run, after `pnpm build`):
`node scripts/model-source-smoke.mjs <HTTPS executor origin>`; hosted runs need
`SIMULATION_SMOKE_TOKEN`. It proves the source pipeline, not transistor-level
performance.

Symbol geometry/pin changes state their known drawing impacts; repair old
layouts only with a bounded one-off when a few deterministic rules suffice.

For unclear, intermittent, cross-layer or real-data defects follow the
[repository workflow](../workflow.md) and record the diagnosis. Raise
intermittent reproduction rates, measure performance before bisecting, report
attempted methods and missing input when no feedback loop exists, redact
private artifacts and obtain authorization for environment access or
production instrumentation.
